Nice things that could be learned from this project:

- Flexbox concepts
	-	We covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
- How to integrate with google maps
	-	The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
- Media queries
	-	All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
